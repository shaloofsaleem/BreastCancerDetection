## Step 1: Installation and Setup

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
```

 The project includes a dataset of breast cancer patients with several features including tumor size, tumor shape, and other characteristics. The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to classify whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on these features.

The project includes several Python scripts for data pre-processing, feature selection, and model training. The project also includes a Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step explanation of the project and the machine learning algorithms used.

The machine learning models used in the project include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The accuracy of these models is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

The project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community. The GitHub repository includes detailed documentation on how to get started with the project and how to contribute to it.
